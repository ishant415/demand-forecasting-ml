# Demand Forecasting for E-commerce

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts future product demand using historical sales data.
It helps businesses plan inventory efficiently and avoid overstocking or understocking.

## 🏭 Industry
E-commerce / Supply Chain

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that forecasts product demand based on past sales trends.

## 📊 Dataset
Historical daily sales data containing:
- Date
- Day index
- Sales quantity

## 🧠 Models Used
- Linear Regression (baseline model)
- Random Forest Regressor (main model)

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Feature preparation  
4. Model training and comparison  
5. Model evaluation using MAE  
6. Saving the best model  
7. Predicting future demand  

## 📈 Evaluation Metric
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## 🧪 Results
Random Forest achieved lower error compared to Linear Regression and was selected for final predictions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn
